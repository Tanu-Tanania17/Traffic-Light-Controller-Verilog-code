The Traffic Signal for main highway gets the highest priority because cars are
continuously present on the main highway. Thus, the main highway signal remains 
Green by default. Occasionally, cars from the country road arrive at the traffic 
signal. The traffic signal for the country road must turn Green only long enough
to let the cars on the country road go.
